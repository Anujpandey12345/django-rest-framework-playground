# DRF By Building 🚀

This repository is a **hands-on learning playground** for **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**.

The goal of this project is simple:
> Learn DRF deeply by building real APIs step by step.

This repo is **not a tutorial clone** — it’s my personal journey of learning, experimenting, and understanding how DRF works internally.
